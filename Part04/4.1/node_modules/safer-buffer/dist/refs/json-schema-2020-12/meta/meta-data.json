ailers` option is set, the `'wantTrailers'` event
         * will be emitted immediately after queuing the last chunk of payload data to be
         * sent. The `http2stream.sendTrailers()` method can then be used to sent trailing
         * header fields to the peer.
         *
         * When `options.waitForTrailers` is set, the `Http2Stream` will not automatically
         * close when the final `DATA` frame is transmitted. User code must call either`http2stream.sendTrailers()` or `http2stream.close()` to close the`Http2Stream`.
         *
         * ```js
         * const http2 = require('node:http2');
         * const server = http2.createServer();
         * server.on('stream', (stream) => {
         *   stream.respondWithFile('/some/file',
